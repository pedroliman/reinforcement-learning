import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def render(env):
    """
    Renders the current state of the environment and displays it as an image.

    This function captures the current state of the environment in RGB format, 
    using the `render_mode` set to 'rgb_array' when the environment was created. 
    It then uses Matplotlib to display the captured image.

    Usage:
        Call this function to visualize the current state of the environment.
        Ensure that the environment is initialized and reset before calling this function.

    Example:
        render()
    """
    # Capture the current state as an RGB image
    state_image = env.render()
    plt.imshow(state_image)
    plt.draw()
    plt.pause(0.1)
    plt.clf()
